# Technical Vocabulary Codex

Welcome to the project, friend!

## Setting Up Environment

- Create GitHub Account
- Setup WSL2 on Windows (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- Setup Debian on WSL2
- Get Project locally (git clone)
- Set up NodeJs Environment on WSL (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-wsl2)
- Profit (in knowledge)

## Application Design

The application will mimic the behaviour of a set of flashcards, cycling between different attributes.

- Tonality
- Interval (single and/or multiple via user option; let's include "modal scale" as an option as well)
- Direction (up up, up down, down up, down down)
- Tempo Tracker
- Articulation
- Major, melodic minor, harmonic minor
- Eventually, a chromatic version of the app, as well (this requires a different design, separately)
